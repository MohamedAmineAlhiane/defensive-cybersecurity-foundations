# defensive-cybersecurity-foundations
A structured collection of defensive network analysis projects focused on understanding baseline behavior, anomaly detection, and MITM reasoning through ethical, theory-driven analysis.

# Defensive Network Analysis Labs

## Overview
This repository serves as a central summary for a series of defensive, theory-driven network analysis projects.  
The purpose of this collection is to demonstrate how normal network behavior can be observed, understood, and used as a reference point for detecting anomalies — without performing attacks or intrusive actions.

The projects follow a structured learning path, progressing from basic observation to advanced analytical reasoning, while maintaining a strict ethical and defensive focus.

## Project Series

### 1. Home Wi-Fi Security Observation Lab
An introductory lab focused on passive observation of a privately owned home Wi-Fi network.  
The project establishes familiarity with normal device behavior, gateway interaction, and background network activity in a real-world environment.

### 2. Idle vs Usage
A comparative analysis of network behavior when a device is idle versus actively used.  
This project highlights how traffic patterns change based on user interaction, emphasizing the role of context and timing in defensive analysis.

---

### 3. Baseline vs Active Behavior
This project focuses on establishing a baseline of normal network behavior over time and comparing it against periods of increased activity.  
It demonstrates how deviations from baseline conditions can be identified and interpreted without assuming malicious intent.

### 4. Gateway Analysis
An analytical examination of network behavior from the gateway (router) perspective.  
The project explores how the gateway’s predictable, rule-based behavior can serve as a reference point for identifying abnormal traffic dynamics.

### 5. MITM Detection (Theory-Only)
A defensive, theory-based project explaining how Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks can be suspected through behavioral indicators such as timing anomalies, baseline deviations, gateway behavior changes, and protocol instability — without executing any active attack.

## Ethical Framework
All projects in this series were conducted on privately owned networks using passive observation only.  
No attacks, traffic interception, or system manipulation were performed. The focus throughout is educational, ethical, and defensive.
